# Frontend Infrastructure Reusable Workflows

[Reusable GitHub workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)
which help implementing a CI/CD pipeline described in this repository.

### Prerequisites

In order to be compatible with these workflows, your SPA needs to meet a few
criteria:

- if your SPA is deployed to different environments with a varying config (like
  API keys, urls etc.), it needs to be able to build an environment agnostic
  deploy bundle, i.e. a bundle which allows injecting a specific environment
  configuration if necessary. The way to accomplish this will vary depending on
  the build tooling you use.
- if your SPA is deployed to different environments, you need to provide a
  command which can inject the config for the selected environment into the
  bundle. If provided, the deploy workflow will invoke that command before
  uploading files to S3. For convenience, the command will be called with
  SPA_BUNDLE_DIR, SPA_ENV and SPA_TREE_HASH environment variables set to the
  corresponding workflow input values
- all the long-cacheable assets like JS/CSS/images need to have a cache buster
  string in their name and they need to be placed in a `${build_dir}/static`
  directory when the production version is built.

## Workflows

### Build

Efficiently runs the build script (defined in `package.json`), bundles and
uploads the result to an S3 registry bucket.

Copies the output files from the registry to the origin S3 bucket and updates
the cursor file for the current branch.
