# Frontend Infrastructure Reusable Workflows

[Reusable GitHub workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)
which help implementing a CI/CD pipeline described in this repository.

### Prerequisites

In order to be compatible with these workflows, your SPA needs to meet a few
criteria:

- if your SPA is deployed to different environments with a varying config (like
  API keys, urls etc.), it needs to be able to build an environment agnostic
  production version, i.e. a bundle without any baked-in configuration that
  differs between environments. The way to accomplish this will vary depending
  on the build tooling you use.
- if your SPA is deployed to different environments you need to provide a
  `apply:config` script in `package.json` which can inject the config for a
  selected environment into the bundle. This workflow will invoke the
  `apply:config` passing 3 CLI arguments: the location of the bundle, the
  environment and the tree hash (i.e. version) deployed.
- all the long-cacheable assets like JS/CSS/images need to have a cache buster
  string in their name and they need to be placed in a `${build_dir}/static`
  directory when the production version is built.

## Workflows

### Build

Efficiently runs the build script (defined in `package.json`), bundles and
uploads the result to an S3 registry bucket.
